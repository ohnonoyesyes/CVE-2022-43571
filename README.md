# CVE-2022-43571

CVE-2022-43571 Splunk RCE – my personal journey to color your life
Only because I got the statement from my IT, there are no reasons for a SPLUNK update, I analyzed this vulnerability CVE-2022-43571 to prove the opposite for a remote code execution. Here is my exploit.

If I had found this vulnerability, I would like to name this „colorful sparklines“ ….. ;-)

@SPLUNK you should not name the vulnerability nor address any details in your code. It was a fast pointer into right direction ;-)
